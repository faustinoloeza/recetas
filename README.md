## Run

Run on web

````
cd guishi
flutter run -d chrome
````

Run on Android or ios

````
cd guishi
flutter run
````

## Build a release app

Desktop

````
flutter build windows
flutter build macos
flutter build linux
````

Web

````
flutter build web
````

Android

````
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
````

*Removing the `--split-per-abi` flag results in a fat APK that contains your code compiled for all the target ABIs. Such APKs are larger in size than their split counterparts, causing the user to download native binaries that are not applicable to their deviceâ€™s architecture.*
